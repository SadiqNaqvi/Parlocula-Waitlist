# Parlocula - Waitlist Website

Parlocula is a community-first social platform built for people who don't just watch movies and shows - but love talking about them.

This repository contains the official **Parlocula Waitlist Landing Page**, designed to introduce the vision, explain the philosophy, and onboard early believers before the public launch.

## 🌌 What is Parlocula?

Parlocula is a home for **Cinements** - movies and shows - and the conversations around them.

Unlike traditional social platforms, Parlocula is:

- Topic-first, not feed-first
- Community-driven, not algorithm-driven
- Built for depth, not dopamine

Every cinement lives beyond the credits through:

- Dedicated cinement wiki pages
- Structured discussion threads
- Personal shelves to track and share your journey
